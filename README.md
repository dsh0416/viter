# Viter

Rails Frontend Develop suit Make you so happy
Use [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite),
Inspired by [webpacker](https://github.com/rails/webpacker), But more powerful:

* for Engine develop: you can import assets files under `app/assets`
* You can put js or css files under `app/views`, same name as action, which will load automatically.


```ruby
gem 'viter'
```

And then execute:
```bash
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:
```bash
$ gem install viter
```
